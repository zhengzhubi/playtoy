Borderline personality disorder (BoPD) is a serious psychological condition that affects 1â€“2% of the general population, and approximately 10% and 20% of psychiatric outpatients and inpatients, respectively [1, 2]. The disorder is characterized by chronic disinhibition, extreme sensitivity, volatile emotions, self-harm, impulsive behaviors and high mortality rate due to suicide (up to 10%) [3, 4]. Indeed, the suicide rate amongst patients with BoPD is approximately 50 times higher than that of the general population [2]. In addition, BoPD is a complex personality disorder that has many comorbid conditions, such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder [5-7]. As such, patients with BoPD are often misdiagnosed, with almost 40% reporting a previous misdiagnosis; the corresponding proportion among patients with other psychological disorders is only 10% [8]. Misdiagnosis of BoPD has serious clinical implications given distinct therapies are developed for each disorder [8], which can result in patients receiving inappropriate treatment.
